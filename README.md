# Thai-NER-BiLSTM-CRF-WordCharEmbedding
Thai Named Entity Recognition with BiLSTM-CRF using Word/Character Embedding

Author: Suphanut Thattinaphanich

[The paper will release soon in some conference in the future (still in progress)]

## Description

The Thai Named Entity Recognition model use Bi-directional LSTM with Word / Character representation and CRF for sequece tagging
Perform keras backend

- Word Embedding : v. 0.32 Thai2Fit 400 dimension
- Char Embedding : Bi-LSTM training from scratch 32 dimension

## Thank to 
- Wannaphong Phatthiyaphaibun (https://github.com/wannaphongcom/thai-ner) for the initial of the Thai NER project
